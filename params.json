  "body": "### The goal of Lighten is to quickly get the right help to the right people, by making it easy to get the right information to the right people.   \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we seek to bring transparency to the social services network by building a universal, web-based platform to standardize and track the exchange of social services information. Not only will this make finding social services much easier for help-seekers in the community, it will greatly reduce the workload of social service providers, freeing them up to spend more time with their help-seeking clients.  \r\n\r\nWe are not another 311-type service. Our aim is to become a publicly accessible infranet, where updates to social services information can be pushed across the network in real time. We envision a future where agencies are transparent, collaborative and have direct control over their own information. Thus we can guarantee that information is ACCURATE and up-to-date, something that no other service can claim. We hope that by using our platform, social service organizations will not only reduce costs and increase the effectiveness of their programs, but will become empowered to use their data in new ways such as in research, community engagement, learning more about their clientele, and other things we might not have thought of.  \r\n\r\nWon't you join us?\r\n",
